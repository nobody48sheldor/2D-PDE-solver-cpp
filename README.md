  # Conduction simulation in C++
A code that **solve** the heat equation (conduction) (**and a lot more**) with **C++** and plot the whole thing with **matplotlib** (Python)

## languages
C++ for the calculation,
Python (with matplotlib) for the plotting

## installation and usage
1) **clone** the repo :

```
git clone https://github.com/nobody48sheldor/conduction-cpp
```

2. ***[Linux / BASH]*** 
- for linux users **run** the `compile-script.sh`

```
sh compile-script.sh
```

2. ***[Windows / Mac] for ohters (manually)***

- **compile** the `conduction.cpp`
- **run** the compiled file

## usefulness and pros

- You can **edit** the line that is used to calculate the next point to solve a lot of **2D-partial-differential** equation, it is **fully open source.**

- It has been made so that it **doesn't take too much RAM** while beeing **user friendly**.

## cons
- **I am a highschool student** so it may not be the best way to make this kind of program since **I am not that experienced**.
- there are some **misscalculation at the boundaries**.
