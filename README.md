# Conduction simulation in C++
A code that solve the heat equation (conduction) with C++ and plot the whole thing with matplotlib

## languages
C++ for the calculation,
Python (with matplotlib) for the plotting

## installation and usage
clone the repo :

```
git clone https://github.com/nobody48sheldor/conduction-cpp
```

and then for linux users start the compile-script.sh

```
sh compile-script.sh
```

for ohters (manually)

-compile the `conduction.cpp`
run the compiled file

## usefulness
You can edit the line that is used to calculate the next point to solve a lot of 2D-partial-differential equation, it is fully open source.
